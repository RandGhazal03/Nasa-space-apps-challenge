Plants in space experience unique environmental conditions, including microgravity and increased radiation. Experiments on the International Space Station have shown that plant roots can still orient and grow, but patterns of gene expression are altered. These findings are critical for developing reliable food production systems for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.
