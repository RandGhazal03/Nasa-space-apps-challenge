🌍 NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 – Bio Dashboard
🔹 Challenge Summary
We need to build a dynamic web application that uses AI, knowledge graphs, and data tools to summarize 608 NASA bioscience publications. The goal is to make it easier for scientists, mission planners, and managers to explore the results and impacts of past space biology experiments, and to identify insights for future Moon and Mars missions.
